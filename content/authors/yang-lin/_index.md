### Principle Investigator

I am an assistant professor in the Soil and Water Sciences Department at the University of Florida. My research interests include soil carbon persistence and decomposition, coupled carbon-nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, redox dynamics in upland soils, and biogeochemical implications of climate change and land use. My field sites spans a wide range of ecosystems, including arid grasslands, sub-tropical forests, and agricultural landscapes. I take a variety of analytical approaches to characterize the physical, chemical, and biological properties of plant, soil, and water samples.

I am looking for MSc and PhD students interested in soil carbon and soil health.  Check out [Opportunities](#opportunities)  for more information on the application! Get in touch with me via email and twitter!
